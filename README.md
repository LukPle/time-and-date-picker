Welcome to our Android application. The app is part of the Open Sorce [Android App Library](https://github.com/LukPle/android-app-library.git) 
and adopts all licensing and community guidelines from this project. Please use the link in order to check out the corresponding repository.

The time-and-date-picker app contains two input fields. One of them opens a **TimePickerDialog** and the other one a **DatePickerDialog**.
Clicking the Button shows a **Toast** message with the selected time and date. The application serves as an example of these features.

## Features
The setting of this program is a reminder app. The user can select a time and date via the two picker. A Toast message shows those values by setting the reminder. </br>
